I'm a Web Developer. I've worked on a few static web-pages using [React](https://reactjs.org/). Ultimately I want to be a Full-Stack Developer.   
Recently I built a Covid19-tracker (like everyone else) and it was for [Karnataka, India](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=karnataka%20india).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Personal Website and building a portfolio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Web Development.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: mohammedimran86992@gmail.com.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Him/He.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to run and as a hobby I collect old currency also known as [Numismatics](https://www.google.com/search?q=numismatics). 
- :heart: Travelling + food + anime.
