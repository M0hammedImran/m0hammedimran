### Hi, I'm Imran 👋

<!--
**M0hammedImran/m0hammedimran** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
I'm a Web Developer. I've worked on a few static web-pages using [React](https://reactjs.org/). Ultimately I want to be a Full-Stack Developer.   
Recently I built a Covid19-tracker (like everyone else) and it was for [Karnataka, India](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=karnataka%20india).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Personal Website and building a portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript.
- 💬 Ask me about Web Development.
- 📫 How to reach me: mohammedimran86992@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: Him/He.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to run and as a hobby I collect old currency also known as [Numismatics](https://www.google.com/search?q=numismatics). 
- :heart: Travelling + food + anime.
